# Uncommon Python ZeroDivisionError

This repository demonstrates an unusual behavior related to the `ZeroDivisionError` exception in Python.  The code contains a function that doesn't always raise the exception when division by zero is attempted, resulting in unexpected outputs instead of the expected error.

The `bug.py` file shows the problematic code.  The `bugSolution.py` file offers a corrected version.  This issue highlights the importance of thorough error handling, even in seemingly straightforward cases.
